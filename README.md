HANGMAN GAME is a fun game that is completely based on Python.
Python libraries used in this game are Random and Time.
Basic knowledge of Python is required in this project.
This game starts with a message that welcomes you to the game.
Then it selects a random word from a defined list in the code.
And the user has to guess the letters of the word.
He will get total 5 chances to guess i.e. if the user guesses a wrong letter 5 times then the user will be hanged(Obviously on paper :-)).
Else if the user guesses correctly then he/she will win the game.
He can also select whether he wants to play again or not.
